\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Initializer lists are a powerful compile time syntax introduced in C++11 but due to their often conflicting syntax they are not used by APIs for construction.

Further standard conforming compilers {\itshape strongly} favor an std\+::initializer\+\_\+list overload for construction if one exists. The following is a simple tag used to disambiguate construction with initializer lists and regular uniform initialization.

For example consider the following case

class Something \{ public\+: explicit Something(int); Something(std\+::initializer\+\_\+list$<$int$>$);

operator int(); \};

... Something something\{1\}; // SURPRISE!!

The last call to instantiate the Something object will go to the initializer\+\_\+list overload. Which may be surprising to users.

If however this tag was used to disambiguate such construction it would be easy for users to see which construction overload their code was referring to. For example

class Something \{ public\+: explicit Something(int); Something(folly\+::initlist\+\_\+construct\+\_\+t, std\+::initializer\+\_\+list$<$int$>$);

operator int(); \};

... Something something\+\_\+one\{1\}; // not the initializer\+\_\+list overload Something something\+\_\+two\{folly\+::initlist\+\_\+construct, \{1\}\}; // correct 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
