\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class acts like {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr} with a custom deleter (although is slightly less fancy in some of the more escoteric respects) except that it keeps a copy of the object rather than a pointer, and we require that the contained object has some kind of "{}invalid"{} value.

Defining a scoper based on this class allows you to get a scoper for non-\/pointer types without having to write custom code for set, reset, and move, etc. and get almost identical semantics that people are used to from {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr}.

It is intended that you will typedef this class with an appropriate deleter to implement clean up tasks for objects that act like pointers from a resource management standpoint but aren\textquotesingle{}t, such as file descriptors and various types of operating system handles. Using {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr} for these things requires that you keep a pointer to the handle valid for the lifetime of the scoper (which is easy to mess up).

For an object to be able to be put into a \doxylink{classkiwi_1_1_scoped_generic}{Scoped\+Generic}, it must support standard copyable semantics and have a specific "{}invalid"{} value. The traits must define a free function and also the invalid value to assign for default-\/constructed and released objects.

A Traits type may choose to track ownership of objects in parallel with \doxylink{classkiwi_1_1_scoped_generic}{Scoped\+Generic}. To do so, it must implement the Acquire and Release methods, which will be called by \doxylink{classkiwi_1_1_scoped_generic}{Scoped\+Generic} during ownership transfers and extend the \doxylink{structkiwi_1_1_scoped_generic_ownership_tracking}{Scoped\+Generic\+Ownership\+Tracking} tag type.
